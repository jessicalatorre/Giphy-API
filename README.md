# Giphy-API

I created a simple Film Maker app using JavaScript and the Giphy API. I started by creating an array of film makers, so a for loop could dynamically create buttons and attributes for each of them as the loop iterates. Each time a user clicks a film maker button, at least 10 corresponding images are retrieved using the Giphy API and are rendered on the browser page. When a user clicks a still image, the gif animates, and after another click, it stops. Ratings for each gif also are displayed above each gif..

Next Steps:
Finish coding the option that allows users to type in a new film maker, so it can be added to the menu of buttons. Once the new button is clicked, corresponding gifs and ratings should displayed for the new film makerâ€™s gifs.
