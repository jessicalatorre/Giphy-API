# Search for gifs of your favorite film makers!:movie_camera:!

# How it Works
*Filmmaker Search* Is an app that uses an AJAX call to the Giphy API to dynamically render filmmaker gifs at the top of the browser page. I thought of the idea because I love indie movies and art house films, and I figured displaying silly and somewhat dry-humored gifs would be a fun way to share these interests.

A few of my favorite filmmakers are listed at the top of the page, but users can also search for their favorite film maker by typing a name into the small text box and clicking the "add-filmmaker" button. This submission adds a new button with the artist's name.

Once the button is clicked, at least ten static gifs are rendered, along with the ratings for each. Users can start and stop animation by clicking on each gif. This handy feature was added, so nobody would be overwhelmed :dizzy_face: if they clicked on all ten gifs. :satisfied:
